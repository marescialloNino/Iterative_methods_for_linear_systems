# Iterative-methods-for-linear-systems
A collection of script and exercises solving linear systems.

There's a manual implementation of the Conjugate Gradient Method, and I make some comparison between my method and scipy's built in methods, preconditioned and not.
As preconditioners I use Jacobi's and Cholesky's.
